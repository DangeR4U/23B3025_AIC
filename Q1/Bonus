Visual-based Transformers (VITs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are both used for image processing, but they differ in their architecture and operation.
VITs utilize self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships in images, while CNNs rely on convolutional layers to extract local features.
VITs excel at modeling global context from the start, whereas CNNs gradually build hierarchical representations from local features.
Diff b/w VITs & CNNs,

Global vs. Local Processing:

VITs focus on capturing global relationships and long-range dependencies in images from the outset through self-attention mechanisms.

CNNs excel at extracting local features and spatial hierarchies through convolutional filters, gradually building up to more complex representations.
