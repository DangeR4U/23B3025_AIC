In IN a 2D grid of constrained straight interlocking paths, the **Frechet Distance** is the preferred metric for comparing distances between any two different paths.
It is superior because it considers the order and continuity of points along the paths, accurately capturing their shapes and structures. Other metrics include:

1. Hausdorff Distance: Measures the greatest distance between points on two paths.
2. Euclidean distance: measures the straight-line distance between corresponding points.
3. Dynamic time Warping (DTW):Aligns sequences of different lengths, but may distort path shapes.
4. Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance)  : Measures the minimum operations needed to transform one sequence into another. 

While these metrics have their uses, they often lack the ability to comprehensively capture the geometric similarity of paths, making the Frechet Distance a more suitable choice for this scenario.
