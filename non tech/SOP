I am writing this SOP per-se to express my enthusiasm in joining the Artificial Community of IITB.
I am driven by deep curiosity and interest to both learn and contribute to the community.
My interest in the field was driven because of AI's similarity to the human intelligence and how this can be used for so many great and interesting causes.
My goals are to build a strong base in AI with the help of the resources and the sessions held within the community.
I also have a desire to seek direct guidance directly from my seniors who are already quite well-versed with the field.
To say the truth, I am quite a beginner in this field but I am all about learning and exploring new tech.
Also I have decent command over programming languages like python,cpp also little bit java(studied in school) and be quite updated about AI advancements through youtube and other such platforms.
I am confident that my enthusiasm, commitment to learning, and active participation will allow me to make meaningful contributions to the community.
Thanks if you have read all this through till now and I am quite excited about joining the community and go on a whole new level of learning and participation.
