First I learnt about word embeddings like whats is their function and how do you convert them and whats the benefit of converting strings (words) into numbers(or vectors). I also learnt the theory about the word embeddings , neural network and learnt to convert Words to Vector using Word2Vec model . I also got to know about how  a Neural Network is trained using backpropagation. I used Glove pre trained word embeddings which i have shared above. I used PCA (Prinicpal component analysis) to reduce the dimension of the dataset to 3 to plot the embeddings using Plotly.
