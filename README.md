Make sure to download and install all the libraries by using pip command.

First I learnt about word embeddings like whats is their function and how do you convert them and whats the benefit of converting strings (words) into numbers(or vectors). I also learnt the theory about the word embeddings , neural network and learnt to convert Words to Vector using Word2Vec model . I also got to know about how  a Neural Network is trained using backpropagation. I used Glove pre trained word embeddings which i have shared above. I used PCA (Prinicpal component analysis) to reduce the dimension of the dataset to 3 to plot the embeddings using Plotly.I have also shared the plot image of the sample corpus which i have taken.

Question 1)
Tried a lot ,first I tried to automatically download the Pascal VOCdevkit 2012, but it didnot work as it stopped automatically in the middle but then I tried to do it manually by putting the VOCdevkit folder in the
same as the code file, but still it didnot work , so i tried it without using the VOCfile but still didnot work. Unfinished code is uploaded. I also learnt about VITs and how they are different from CNNs.
